# Lawrence React Sample

This is something I threw together in early September 2023 to have a sample to assist in my job search.
 
## Build/Run the project

This is a React JS/TS project.  It is a simple showcase of some chart widgets, and a couple animated widgets
using the twojs-ts graphics/drawing package available through npm.

If you do not have npm installed, please install it.

In the project directory, you can run:

### 'npm install'

This will ensure that you have the necessary packages downloaded to run this project.

Once installed, run:

### `npm start`

T run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
